# Survey App  
A simple survey app using android architecture components using kotlin and Android Jetpack Components.
  
## Architecture 
MVVM architecture is a Model-View-ViewModel architecture that removes the tight coupling between each component.

## Tech-stack  
  
* Tech-stack  
  * [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference.  
  * [Live data](https://kotlinlang.org/) - LiveData is a data holder class that can be observed within a given lifecycle.  
  * [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.  
  * [HILT](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) -Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project.   
  * [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android.  
  * [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) - a persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite.  
  * [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - ViewModel is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. Write perfect code that works consistently across all Android versions and devices.  
  * [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) - a highly extensible android logger.  
  * [Shimmer for Android](https://facebook.github.io/shimmer-android/) - Shimmer is an Android library that provides an easy way to add a shimmer effect to any view in your Android app.  
  * [Kotlin flows](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow) - a flow is a type that can emit multiple values sequentially, as opposed to suspend functions that return only a single value.   
  * [DiffUtil](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/recyclerview/widget/DiffUtil) - DiffUtil is a utility class that calculates the difference between two lists and outputs a list of update operations that converts the first list into the second one.
  * [OkHttp interceptor](https://square.github.io/okhttp/interceptors/) - logs HTTP request and response data.
  * [WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager) - allows you to schedule work to run one- time or repeatedly using flexible scheduling windows.
